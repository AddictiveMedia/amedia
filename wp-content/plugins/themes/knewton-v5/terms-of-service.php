		    <h1>KNEWTON TERMS OF SERVICE</h1>

		    <p><strong>Last Updated: August 24, 2015</strong></p>

		    <p>Knewton, Inc. (“<strong>Knewton</strong>,” “<strong>we</strong>,” or
		    “<strong>us</strong>”) provides, through this Web site (the
		    “<strong>Site</strong>”) and through our online adaptive learning platform,
		    the ability to use certain functionalities of the Site and our learning
		    services (collectively, the “<strong>Services</strong>”). The following
		    terms of service (these “<strong>terms</strong>”) apply to all of our
		    Services. Please read them carefully. This agreement was written in English
		    (US). To the extent any translated version of this agreement conflicts with
		    the English version, the English version controls. Also, we understand that
		    website terms can be hard to digest because of the legalese, so we have
		    provided a non-legalese summary on the right side of our terms as well.
		    This plain English summary is intended to provide transparency, but is not
		    a substitute for our actual terms.</p>

		            <h3>1. AGREEING TO THESE TERMS</h3>

		            <div class="annotation-wrap pr">
		                <div class="privacy-note ">
		                    <h5>Basically,</h5>

		                    <p>by using Knewton (or allowing your child or student to
		                    use Knewton) you agree to all the terms below. If you are
		                    under 18, please check with your parent or teacher before
		                    using Knewton.</p>
		                </div>

		                <p id="annotation-0">By accessing the Site, viewing any
		                content, or using any of the Services, you are agreeing to be
		                bound by these terms, which together with our <a href=
		                "/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a>, governs our relationship
		                with users in relation to the Services and constitute a binding
		                legal agreement. If you disagree with any part of the terms or
		                our <a href="/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>, do not use
		                the Services. Because many users of the Services are not of
		                legal age to form a binding contract (in many places, this is
		                18 years old) (each such user, a “<strong>Minor</strong>”),
		                Knewton has the following important rules in place about who
		                must agree to these terms:</p>
		            </div>

		            <ul>
		                <li>If you have the legal capacity to form a binding contract,
		                then you must agree to these terms before using the
		                Services.</li>

		                <li>If you do not have the legal capacity to form a binding
		                contract, you may use the Services only if (a) your parent or
		                guardian has agreed to these terms for you or (b) you are a
		                student and are being provided Services in connection with your
		                school activities and, to the extent permitted under applicable
		                law, an instructor or other authorized personnel of your school
		                or other institution (collectively,
		                “<strong>Educators</strong>”) has agreed to these terms for you
		                on the school’s behalf.</li>

		                <li>By agreeing to these terms, you represent that you have the
		                authority and legal capacity to do so. If you are agreeing to
		                these terms as a parent or guardian on behalf of a user because
		                they are a Minor, then you will be responsible for that Minor’s
		                use of the Services and other obligations and commitments under
		                these terms. If you are agreeing to these terms as an Educator
		                on behalf of your students who are Minors, then you represent
		                that you are agreeing to these terms on your school’s behalf
		                and that your school will be responsible for its student’s use
		                of the Services and other obligations and commitments under
		                these terms. In these terms, we use the term
		                “<strong>you</strong>” and “<strong>your</strong>” to refer to
		                both the individual agreeing to these terms and any user for
		                whom that individual has agreed to these terms as a parent,
		                guardian or Educator of such user, as applicable.</li>

		                    <h5>Basically,</h5>

		                    <p>we have really cool technology that personalizes

		                </div>

		                <p id="annotation-1">Our technology allows us to personalize
		                online education for our users. When it is integrated with
		                online learning materials, our technology causes the
		                presentation and focus of the course materials to adapt based
		                on the user’s needs and how they learn best, and also provides
		                analytic reporting to help track the user’s progress. This
		                technology is key to most of our Service offerings.</p>

		                    <h5>Basically,</h5>

		                    <p>we offer two main services. You can access our
		                    “enterprise service” through our partners’ products. You
		                    can access our “consumer service” directly through our
		                    website. Our terms of service vary depending on which
		                    service you are using.</p>
		                </div>

		                <p id="annotation-2">We currently provide the following
		                Services online:</p>

		                <ul>
		                    <li><strong>Enterprise Service.</strong> We have integrated
		                    our technology with online learning materials that are
		                    provided by schools, publishers and other third parties
		                    (“<strong>Enterprise Partners</strong>”). The
		                    “<strong>Enterprise Service</strong>” refers to the
		                    adaptive learning Services that we provide to users of
		                    those course materials. For users of the Enterprise
		                    Service, the “Additional Terms for Enterprise Service”
		                    listed below will apply as well as the “General Terms”
		                    listed below.</li>

		                    <li><strong>Consumer Service.</strong> The
		                    “<strong>Consumer Service</strong>” refers to the Services
		                    that we provide through this Site. As of October 2014, the
		                    Knewton Consumer Service is in beta phase located at
		                    beta.knewton.com and all features are not yet available for
		                    general use. The Consumer Service (1) allows each user to
		                    create adaptively powered learning experiences using our
		                    technology with content that a user supplies or is provided
		                    from Knewton’s content library (the “<strong>Content
		                    Library</strong>”) available at beta.knewton.com and (2)
		                    allows each user to access those adaptively powered
		                    learning experiences and the other services we make
		                    available as part of the Consumer Service. For users of the
		                    Consumer Service, the “Additional Terms for Consumer
		                    Service” listed below will apply as well as the “General
