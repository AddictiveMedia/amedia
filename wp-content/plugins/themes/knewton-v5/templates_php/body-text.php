			<h3>Basics</h3>
		
			<p>Knewton, Inc. (“Knewton”, “we”, “us”) is founded on the principle that every student in the world should be able to receive a high-quality education tailored to his or her needs. We understand that data collected from individuals, especially students and children, is a sensitive issue and that it is incumbent upon us to be as transparent as possible about our privacy practices.</p>
	
			<p>In order to understand our privacy practices, it is important for you to understand, as further detailed in our terms of service, that we currently offer two distinct product offerings. One is our adaptive learning services that we offer through products offered by schools, publishers, and other third parties (collectively, “Enterprise Partners”) that are integrated with our online adaptive learning platform (the “Platform”). We specifically refer to the adaptive learning services that we provide to users of our Enterprise Partners’ products as the “Enterprise Service.” The other is an adaptive learning service and related services that we offer through this Web site (the “Site”). We specifically refer to the services offered through the Site as the “Consumer Service” and refer to the Enterprise Service and Consumer Service collectively, as the “Services.” As of June 2014, the Knewton Consumer Service is in beta phase located at beta.knewton.com and all features are not yet available for general use.</p>
			
			<h3>Information Collected</h3>
			
			<h4>From Whom Do We Collect Information?</h4>
			
			<p>Although our Site and the online course materials offered through our Enterprise Partners’ products contain content that is applicable to users of all ages, certain portions of our Site (<strong>specifically</strong> certain activities, certain content, and the collection of Personal Information through our Consumer Service) are intended exclusively for users at least 13 years of age and Parents of Children. Accordingly, we limit access to the Consumer Service to users that identify themselves as at least 13 years of age when establishing a Knewton Account (“Registered Users”) and only provide access to certain activities, content, and collection of Personal Information to such Registered Users. We collect information and Usage Data (as further detailed in the next section) from a Registered User when that user creates a Knewton Account and also as that Registered User accesses and interacts with the Services.</p>
			
			<p>Where any individual of any age accesses and interacts with the Enterprise Service through our Enterprise Partners’ products (an “Enterprise User”), we also collect Usage Data (as further detailed in the next section) from that Enterprise User. However, we do not knowingly collect or receive from that Enterprise User or our Enterprise Partners any Personal Identifiers of such Enterprise User, nor we do link any Usage Data collected from such Enterprise User to a Knewton Account (thus avoiding any personal identification of such data), unless such Enterprise User (or if such user is a Child, such Child’s Parent) has established a Knewton Account and authorized an Enterprise Partner’s product to link to such Knewton Account.</p>
			
			<h3>What Information Do We Collect?</h3>
	
			<p>We collect the following types of information, both directly from you when you use and access the Consumer Service and indirectly through our Enterprise Partners when you use and access the Enterprise Service:</p>
