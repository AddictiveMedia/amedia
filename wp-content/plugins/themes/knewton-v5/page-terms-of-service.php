                    <p>Knewton, Inc. (<strong>Knewton</strong>, <strong>we</strong>, or <strong>us</strong>) provides, through this Web site (the <strong>Site</strong>) and through our online adaptive learning platform, the ability to use certain functionalities of the Site and our learning services (collectively, the <strong>Services</strong>). The following terms of service (these <strong>terms</strong>) apply to all of our Services.  Please read them carefully.  This agreement was written in English (US). To the extent any translated version of this agreement conflicts with the English version, the English version controls. Also, we understand that website terms can be hard to digest because of the legalese, so we have provided a non-legalese summary on the right side of our terms as well. This plain English summary is intended to provide transparency, but is not a substitute for our actual terms.</p>

                        <h4>1.  AGREEING TO THESE TERMS</h4>
                        <p id="annotation-0">By accessing the Site, viewing any content, or using any of the Services, you are agreeing to be bound by these terms, which together with our <a href="/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a>, governs our relationship with users in relation to the Services and constitute a binding legal agreement. If you disagree with any part of the terms or our <a href="/privacy-policy">Privacy Policy</a>, do not use the Services. Because many users of the Services are not of legal age to form a binding contract (in many places, this is 18 years old) (each such user, a <strong>Minor</strong>), Knewton has the following important rules in place about who must agree to these terms:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If you have the legal capacity to form a binding contract, then you must agree to these terms before using the Services. </li>
                            <li>If you do not have the legal capacity to form a binding contract, you may use the Services only if (a) your parent or guardian has agreed to these terms for you or (b) you are a student and are being provided Services in connection with your school activities and, to the extent permitted under applicable law, an instructor or other authorized personnel of your school or other institution (collectively, <strong>Educators</strong>) has agreed to these terms for you on the schools behalf.</li>
                            <li>By agreeing to these terms, you represent that you have the authority and legal capacity to do so.  If you are agreeing to these terms as a parent or guardian on behalf of a user because they are a Minor, then you will be responsible for that Minors use of the Services and other obligations and commitments under these terms.  If you are agreeing to these terms as an Educator on behalf of your students who are Minors, then you represent that you are agreeing to these terms on your schools behalf and that your school will be responsible for its students use of the Services and other obligations and commitments under these terms. In these terms, we use the term <strong>you</strong> and <strong>your</strong> to refer to both the individual agreeing to these terms and any user for whom that individual has agreed to these terms as a parent, guardian or Educator of such user, as applicable.</li>

                        <p id="annotation-1">Our technology allows us to personalize online education for our users.  When it is integrated with online learning materials, our technology causes the presentation and focus of the course materials to adapt based on the users needs and how they learn best, and also provides analytic reporting to help track the users progress.  This technology is key to most of our Service offerings.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Enterprise Service.</strong>  We have integrated our technology with online learning materials that are provided by schools, publishers and other third parties (<strong>Enterprise Partners</strong>).  The <strong>Enterprise Service</strong> refers to the adaptive learning Services that we provide to users of those course materials.  For users of the Enterprise Service, the Additional Terms for Enterprise Service listed below will apply as well as the General Terms listed below.</li>
                            <li><strong>Consumer Service.</strong>  The <strong>Consumer Service</strong> refers to the Services that we provide through this Site. As of October 2014, the Knewton Consumer Service is in beta phase located at beta.knewton.com and all features are not yet available for general use. The Consumer Service (1) allows each user to create adaptively powered learning experiences using our technology with content that a user supplies or is provided from Knewtons content library (the <strong>Content Library</strong>) available at beta.knewton.com and (2) allows each user to access those adaptively powered learning experiences and the other services we make available as part of the Consumer Service.  For users of the Consumer Service, the Additional Terms for Consumer Service listed below will apply as well as the General Terms listed below.</li>

                            We create a personalized learning profile for each user based on their interactions with online learning materials that use our adaptive learning technology (a <strong>Learning Profile</strong>).  In cases where a Knewton Account or Child Account (as described below) has been created, we may be able to apply and link this Learning Profile across multiple online learning courses and subject domains that a user interacts with (including the Consumer Service and third party online learning applications) and which use our adaptive learning technology.  If no Knewton Account has been created, then our ability to use the Learning Profile will be more limited where we are unable to identify the same user across multiple online learning courses. <br /><br />
                            By using the Services you hereby consent to: our collection and/or receipt, either directly or indirectly, of data about your interactions with online learning materials that use our adaptive learning technology (<strong>Usage Data</strong>), the creation of a Learning Profile using such Usage Data, and the access, storage, use and sharing of that Usage Data in accordance with our Privacy Policy and as indicated in your privacy settings.<br /><br />
                            By using the Services you also acknowledge and agree that we may collect, receive, access, store and use Usage Data in anonymized (i.e. de-identified) form in order to operate our Services and improve and inform our internal platform technologies, including troubleshooting, data analysis, testing and research.<br /><br />

In each case you represent and warrant that: (i) you have sufficient rights to grant the license that you choose for a given item of User Content and (ii) no additional permissions, clearances or licenses are required with respect to any third party content, names and likenesses or other items that may be included in such item of User Content.<br /><br /></li>

Each Consumer User shall not download or otherwise copy any User Content unless expressly permitted by the functionality of the Consumer Service (e.g. a download or similar link is provided with the User Content) or the prior written consent of Knewton or the respective licensors of the User Content. Each Consumer User agrees not to circumvent, disable or otherwise interfere with security-related features of the Consumer Service that prevent or restrict use or copying of any User Content or enforce limitations on use of the Consumer Service or the User Content therein.<br /><br />If you are the owner of User Content submitted for the Content Library, you understand and agree, however, that User Content may remain viewable outside of the Consumer Service to the extent that any item of User Content was copied or stored by other Consumer Users in violation of these terms.

If we remove or disable access to User Content in response to a notice of Infringement, we will make reasonable attempts to contact the user who posted the affected User Content. If your User Content was removed and you feel that your User Content is not infringing, you may provide Knewton with a counter notice in writing to the attention of our Copyright Agent, as detailed below. You must include in your counter notice sufficient information to enable Knewton to make a reasonable determination. Please note that you may be held accountable for damages (including costs and attorneys' fees) if you materially misrepresent that your User Content is not infringing the copyrights of others. If you are uncertain whether an activity constitutes Infringement, we recommended seeking advice of an attorney.</p>
